## Challenge Proposal

Smart Fit, being deeply intertwined with the fitness industry, underwent significant shifts during the pandemic. This project's focus is on crafting a page for scouting Smart Fit units, whether **closed** or **open**, facilitating consultation and reservations.

In tackling this test, I endeavored to implement the stipulated functionalities while being mindful of the outlined business rules. The overall aim was to adhere to the provided material, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

### Functionalities

- **Data Fetching:** Loaded unit data locally using the `GET` method from the locations.json file in the project directory. This local file serves as a mock data source, facilitating rapid development and testing.
- **Search:** Implemented the ability to search for all units and apply filters.
- **Unit Display:** Dynamically displayed units while searching, adhering to the provided layout.

### Business Rules

- **Filtering:** Implemented filters for open/closed units and operating hours.
- **User Feedback:** Incorporated user-friendly messages, such as "No units found" when applicable.
- **Icon Validation:** Ensured correct icons were displayed based on the unit's status.

### Tech Stack

- **TypeScript:** Leveraged TypeScript for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **Vite:** Utilized Vite for fast and efficient development and building.
- **React.js:** Employed React.js for building the user interface with its component-based architecture.
- **SASS:** Styled the components with SASS for maintainable and modular styling.
